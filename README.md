# FCOR-599 Project: **SOMUAH BEATRICE**  
**Spatial Data Analysis & Remote Sensing for Forest Carbon Monitoring**


## Overview

Welcome to my **FCOR-599** project repository! This project focuses on assessing forest carbon dynamics through spatial data analysis and remote sensing techniques. The goal is to analyze forest cover changes, monitor carbon flux, and predict forest carbon sequestration potential using high-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 and Landsat) and vegetation indices (NDVI, NBR).

### Key Features:
- **Objective 1**: Analyze forest cover change over time using NDVI.
- **Objective 2**: Estimate forest carbon stocks through remote sensing and spatial modeling.
- **Objective 3**: Evaluate the effectiveness of forest management practices in enhancing carbon sequestration.
